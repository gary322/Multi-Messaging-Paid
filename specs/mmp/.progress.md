## Risks / Blockers Log

- Need final legal/compliance decision on custodial balance handling before public beta.
- Need final confirmation on external channel scope (Telegram-only vs Telegram + WhatsApp + X in v1).
- Need contract audit team and timeline aligned before mainnet deployment.
- Set production `DATABASE_BACKEND=postgres` and run migrations from `api/scripts/migrate.ts`; sqlite/json remains local-only fallback.
- Next.js build/lint in this repo uses strict compile checks; ensure CI env has enough resources for full monorepo compile.
